# MASTER_PLAN: claude-config-pro

## Identity

**Type:** meta-infrastructure
**Languages:** Bash (85%), Markdown (10%), Python (3%), JSON (2%)
**Root:** /Users/turla/.claude
**Created:** 2026-03-01
**Last updated:** 2026-03-01

The Claude Code configuration directory. It shapes how Claude Code operates across all projects via hooks, agents, skills, and instructions. Managed as a git repository (juanandresgs/claude-config-pro). The hook system enforces governance (git safety, documentation, proof gates, worktree discipline) while the agent system dispatches specialized roles (planner, implementer, tester, guardian) for all project work.

## Architecture

    agents/        — Agent instruction files (planner, implementer, tester, guardian)
    hooks/         — Hook entry points (4) + domain libraries (6) — the governance engine
    hooks/*-lib.sh — Domain libraries: core, trace, plan, doc, session, source, git, ci
    scripts/       — Utility scripts (batch-fetch, ci-watch, worktree-roster, statusline)
    skills/        — Research and workflow skills (deep-research, observatory, decide, prd)
    commands/      — Lightweight slash commands (compact, backlog, todos)
    tests/         — Test suite (131 tests via run-hooks.sh + specialized test files)
    templates/     — Document templates for plans and initiatives
    observatory/   — Self-improving flywheel: trace analysis, signal surfacing

## Original Intent

> Build a configuration layer for Claude Code that enforces engineering discipline — git safety, documentation, proof-before-commit, worktree isolation — across all projects. The system should be self-governing: hooks enforce rules mechanically, agents handle specialized roles, and the observatory learns from traces to improve over time.

## Principles

1. **Mechanical Enforcement** — Rules are enforced by hooks, not by convention. If a behavior matters, a hook gates it.
2. **Main is Sacred** — Feature work happens in worktrees. Main only receives tested, reviewed, approved merges.
3. **Proof Before Commit** — Every implementation must be verified by the tester agent before Guardian can commit. The proof chain is: implement -> test -> verify -> commit.
4. **Ephemeral Agents, Persistent Plans** — Agents are disposable; MASTER_PLAN.md and traces persist. Every agent must leave enough context for the next one to succeed.
5. **Fail Loudly** — Silent failures are the enemy. Hooks deny rather than silently allow. Tests assert rather than skip. Traces classify rather than ignore.

## Decision Log

| Date | DEC-ID | Initiative | Decision | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-01 | DEC-HOOKS-001 | metanoia-remediation | Fix shellcheck violations inline (not suppress) | Real fixes are safer than disable annotations; violations indicate real fragility |
| 2026-03-01 | DEC-TRACE-002 | metanoia-remediation | Agent-type-aware outcome classification via lookup table | Different agents have different success signals; lookup table is extensible |
| 2026-03-01 | DEC-TRACE-003 | metanoia-remediation | Write compliance.json at trace init, update at finalize | Prevents write-before-read race when agents crash early |
| 2026-03-01 | DEC-PLAN-004 | metanoia-remediation | Reduce planner.md by extracting templates | 641 lines / 31KB consumes excessive context; target ~400 lines / ~20KB |
| 2026-03-01 | DEC-STATE-005 | metanoia-remediation | Registry-based state file cleanup | Orphaned state files accumulate; registry + cleanup script prevents drift |
| 2026-03-01 | DEC-TEST-006 | metanoia-remediation | Validation harness follows existing run-hooks.sh pattern | Consistency with 131-test suite; no new framework needed |

| Initiative | Period | Phases | Key Decisions | Archived |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Production Remediation (Metanoia Suite) | 2026-02-28 to 2026-03-01 | 5 | DEC-HOOKS-001 thru DEC-TEST-006 | No |

### Production Remediation (Metanoia Suite) — Summary

Fixed defects left by the metanoia hook consolidation (17 hooks -> 4 entry points + 6 domain libraries). Five phases over 3 days:

1. **CI Green** (919a2f0): Migrated 131 tests to consolidated hooks, 0 failures.
2. **Trace Reliability** (1372603): Shellcheck clean, agent-type-aware classification, compliance.json race fix, repair-traces.sh, 15 trace classification tests.
3. **Planner Reliability** (3796e35): planner.md slimmed 641->389 lines via template extraction, max_turns 40->65, silent dispatch fixes.
4. **State Cleanup** (22aff13): Worktree-roster cleans breadcrumbs on removal, resolve_proof_file falls back gracefully, clean-state.sh audit script.
5. **Validation Harness** (b36f3ad): 20 trace fixtures across 4 agent types x 5 outcomes, validation harness with 95% accuracy gate, regression detection via baseline diffing.

All P0 requirements satisfied. 6 architectural decisions recorded (DEC-HOOKS-001 through DEC-TEST-006). Issues closed: #39, #40, #41, #42.
